    HTML form-based authentication, MF, 

Authentication vulnerabilities: 

- Weak password 

- Improper restriction of authentication attempts

- Verbose error message

- Vunerable transmission of credentials: HTTP vs HTTPS   

- Insecure forgot password functionality

- Defects in multistage login mechanism

- Insecure storage of credentials

2. Impact of authentication vulnerabilities

- Confidentiality - access to users' data
- Ingegrity - access to update other users' data
- Avaibility - access to delete users and their data

3. How to find and exploit 

- Weak pass: register several accounts with different kinds of weak pass --> rules

- Improper restriction of authentication attempts: 

submit several bad logins -> (not lockout message) log correct -> v no lockout

Brute force

Locked out --> monitor request, responses

- Vunerable transmission of credentials: 

log in

Find credentials in URL query, cookie,...
