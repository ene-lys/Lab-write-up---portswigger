1 What?

Attacker execute commands on host OS via vulnerable application

Human --> (ping IP addr: 127.0.0.1) --> web app (vul) --> ICMP addr --> web server
=> back

Attacker --> (cat passwd) --> web app (ping + cat) --> web server 
=> back

types:

- In-band: receive response in the application

- Blind: not return output in response


Impact:

- C: View sensitive information

- I: alter content in app

- A: delete content in app


2. How to find:

- map all instances

- Fuzz the application: &,&&,|,||,;,\n,...

- In-band --> analyse response

- Blind --> ??? - time delay: sleep(10), ping
